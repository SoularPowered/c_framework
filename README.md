## ABOUT
This framework is to assist in quickly setting up a terminal-based, console interface program in C without using any special libraries. The goal is to make setting up projects for class assignments quick and painless, allowing a user to simply add the necessarily includes they require for their project and call functions with less boilerplate.

## HOW-TO
Start by adding your custom .c files to the SRC listings in the makefile and headers to the HEADERS listings. Use client.c to populate the main_loop() function with function calls as necessary.  
The main menu will print out the statements in print_menu(), so populate the menu options there.  
Currently, menu items must be hard-coded into the program and you should verify that the number of menu options you provide match the switch case in main_loop().


### USE NOTE
I highly recommend you do NOT use this for your assignments if you
attend Oregon State University, although allow it to inspire you. I used
ALL parts and many variations of this framework to complete my assignments
and this would be considered cheating to re-use.  

If you are attending any other university, please follow their guidelines, but
*always* credit me, the author, and cite my github as the source.  

If you have suggestions for improvements, please email me! Thanks.
