USE NOTE
========
I highly recommend you do NOT use this for your assignments if you
attend Oregon State University, although allow it to inspire you. I used
ALL parts and many variations of this framework to complete my assignments
and this would be considered cheating to re-use.

If you are attending any other university, please follow their guidelines, but
*always* credit me, the author, and cite my github as the source.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please email me! Thanks.
